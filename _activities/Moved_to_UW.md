Following the successful completion of my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Clarkson University, I relocated to [Madison, Wisconsin](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Madison,+WI/@43.0852183,-89.4915483,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8806536d3a2019ff:0x4e0cfcb5ba484198!8m2!3d43.0721661!4d-89.4007501!16zL20vMGZ3Mnk?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in January and joined the [Neuroergonomics Lab](https://neuroergolab.org/) at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) as a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.
