For the past two years, I worked as a graduate researcher in the Astronautics and Robotics Laboratory (ASTRO Lab) under the supervision of Dr. Michael C. F. Bazzocchi (add to bazz name https://www.clarkson.edu/people/michael-bazzocchi). During this period, I developed a comprehensive motion-capture dataset for firefighter activities and contributed to the design and development of an intelligent, adaptive firefighter exoskeleton. I successfully completed my degree in December.
