Presented two of our recent works at the HFES 2025 event held in Chicago!

Astronauts experience vestibular impairments induced by altered gravity during spaceflight. My first talk focused on how these vestibular impairments affect postural balance and neural activation using Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) and fNIRS neuroimaging.

Coexisting spaceflight hazards such as vestibular impairments and mental fatigue can influence fine motor coordination, which is essential for mission-critical operational tasks. The second talk explained how these interacting factors shape fine motor performance under spaceflight-analog conditions.

Our project received the [Best Student Work Award](https://hfes-aerospace.org/2025/11/04/aspire-25-highlights/) in the HFES Aerospace Systems Technical Group (ASTG) this year.
