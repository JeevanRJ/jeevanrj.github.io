Irrespective of existing firefighter gear, thousands of fireground injuries are reported annually.

Can a firefighter exoskeleton help? The lack of firefighter biomechanical data is a major challenge in designing firefighter specific assistive devices and exoskeleton. We collected data from professional firefighters to create a comprehensive database of firefighter biomechanics.  Firefighter activities were visualized in MVN software, and musculoskeletal simulation were conducted in Anybody Modelling System after applying virtual forces correspond to external loads.

Closed-loop human-machine interface is invaluable to development of exoskeletons aiming safety, comfort, and performance. Showing below is using simple PID controller in AMS to keep the activation level of a targeted muscle at the desired level, during elbow flexion under external load (black arrow).

Developing the control system while accounting for human-exoskeleton interactions can reduce number of iterations needed in the prototyping

Actuator selection was done to match the biomechanical demands of firefighter activities (joint rmp, torque values) while minimizing weight, size, and cost. CAN communication was used to establish communication between the actuators and controller. Also, multiple active and passive control strategies were tested prioritizing safety and smooth performance.
