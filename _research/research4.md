**Can a firefighter exoskeleton help?**
The lack of firefighter-specific biomechanical data remains a major challenge in the design of effective assistive devices and exoskeletons. To address this gap, we collected biomechanical data from professional firefighters to create a comprehensive database of firefighter movement and loading patterns. Firefighter activities were visualized using MVN software, and musculoskeletal simulations were performed in the AnyBody Modeling System by applying virtual forces corresponding to external loads.

Closed-loop human-machine interface is invaluable to development of exoskeletons aiming safety, comfort, and performance. Showing below is using simple PID controller in AMS to keep the activation level of a targeted muscle at the desired level, during elbow flexion under external load (black arrow).

Developing the control system while accounting for human-exoskeleton interactions can reduce number of iterations needed in the prototyping

Actuator selection was done to match the biomechanical demands of firefighter activities (joint rmp, torque values) while minimizing weight, size, and cost. CAN communication was used to establish communication between the actuators and controller. Also, multiple active and passive control strategies were tested prioritizing safety and smooth performance.
