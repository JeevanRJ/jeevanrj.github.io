## Firefighter Biomechanics and Exoskeleton Design

This work focuses on task-specific musculoskeletal loading asymmetries
during firefighting activities and their implications for lower-extremity
exoskeleton design.

**Methods:**
- Motion capture
- Inverse dynamics
- Joint moment analysis
- Load carriage simulation
