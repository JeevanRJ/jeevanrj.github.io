Coal remains the main source of power in many countries. Coal yards are prone to spontaneous ignition; a problem faced in every country that stores or transports coal. Depending on the environment, temperature, ventilation, and the rank of the coal-heating and self-ignition can be a longer or shorter process, but the possibility can never be entirely dismissed!

This project investigated a cost-effective, proactive approach for mitigating fire hazards in coal yards. A journal publication detailing this work is [available here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40789-022-00488-y).
