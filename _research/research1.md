Characterizing the risk due to multiple spaceflight hazards 

Sensorimotor functions have been very important for the mission success in the past space missions, and it will be even more so in the future long-range missions to mars and beyond where landing crew support can be spare. Astronauts experience multiple spaceflight hazards during the missions such as altered gravity and fatigue due to work overload and sleep deprivation.  

Do Concurrent occurrence of these factors impair sensorimotor functions or can humans push the boundaries to adapt and sustain performance under these challenging conditions? 

To uncover these questions, we conducted human subject experiments while recording multimodal physiological data such as brain imaging, eye tracking, full body kinematics, muscle activations, and heart rate. This setup allowed us to look at impairments and compensatory mechanisms.

Lab streaming layer (LSL) was used to collect multimodal data in a synchronized manner. Multiple routers were used to connect the devices wirelessly to the data collection PCs, and error checking mechanism were implemented to streamline the data collection.

Post landing effects due to altered gravity was recreated in the lab environment using Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) by providing a small, controlled current of 2mA range across mastoid process aeras creating an electric field across those points. This effectively jam the signal from vestibular system to the brain.

Participants performed a sensorimotor test battery with 13 different activities under interactive effects of GVS and fatigue.

Mental fatigue equivalent to work overload was induced via a two-back session that needed participants to engage in a working memory task for two continuous hours, and sleep deprivation related fatigue needed them to stay awake overnight while repeating the sensorimotor test battery four equally phased time points in the night. In addition to the multimodal physiological data, additional fatigue assessments were done using Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and Profile of Mood States (POMS).

We have found interesting physiological behaviors in brain activations and other physiological data under the interactive effect of altered gravity and fatigue, and the journal publications are under preparation.
