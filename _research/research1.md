Characterizing the risk due to multiple spaceflight hazards 

Sensorimotor functions have been very important for the mission success in the past space missions, and it will be even more so in the future long-range missions to mars and beyond where landing crew support can be spare. Astronauts experience multiple spaceflight hazards during the missions such as altered gravity and fatigue due to work overload and sleep deprivation.  

Do Concurrent occurrence of these factors impair sensorimotor functions or can humans push the boundaries to adapt and sustain performance under these challenging conditions? 

To uncover these questions, we conducted human subject experiments while recording multimodal physiological data such as brain imaging, eye tracking, full body kinematics, muscle activations, and heart rate. This setup allowed us to look at impairments and compensatory mechanisms.
