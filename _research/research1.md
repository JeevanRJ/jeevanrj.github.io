I investigate how Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) disrupts postural
control and gait stability under cognitive fatigue and sensory conflict.

**Data modalities:**
- fNIRS (HbO/HbR)
- Full-body kinematics
- Force plate
- EMG

**Applications:** astronaut sensorimotor performance, fall-risk prediction.
