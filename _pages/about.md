Hi! I am Jeevan Jayasuriya, a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Neuroergonomics Lab](https://neuroergolab.org/) at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Dr. Ranjana Mehta](https://engineering.wisc.edu/directory/profile/ranjana-mehta/). My research interests span neuroergonomics and human factors, with a focus on assistive devices and human–machine interaction systems that integrate mechatronic design, deep learning–based temporal models, and control systems. Currently, I am working on understanding and optimizing astronaut sensorimotor performance under the combined effects of altered gravity and fatigue. 

I received my B.Tech. (Hons.) in Mechatronics Engineering from [The Open University of Sri Lanka](https://ou.ac.lk/) and a B.S. (Hons.) in Physics from the [University of Sri Jayewardenepura](https://www.sjp.ac.lk/), followed by an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/). My prior experience includes microcontroller-based mobile robotics, automation in safety-critical environments, biomechanics and musculoskeletal analysis, wearable sensing, machine learning–based physiological signal processing, and adaptive exoskeleton design. 

My research activities, publications, teaching and mentorship, and other academic activities are available under the relevant tabs, with selected analysis code and tools available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JeevanRJ?tab=repositories). The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:jayauriyaar@wisc.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevanjayasuriya/).
