## Overview

My research focuses on analyzing multimodal physiological and behavioral data
to understand how human sensorimotor control and performance vary under
challenging conditions such as space travel and firefighting.

I integrate brain imaging, movement kinematics, eye gaze, muscle activation,
heart rate, and subjective perception with data-driven methods including
statistics, machine learning, and deep learning–based temporal models.
